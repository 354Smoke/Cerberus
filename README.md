Derivative of the Rostock 3D delta printer. Cerberus is an experimental 3D Delta Robot printer that uses spectra filament for the vertical carriage drive system instead of traditional toothed belts. Please be aware that there will probably (and most likely) be significant changes and improvements made to this design. - A photo gallery of the Ceberus prototype can be found in my G+ gallery here: http://tinyurl.com/amwygs6

A BOM is being worked on and will be made available as a spreadsheet in the near future.

Notes:

1- Due to the high tension required of the spectra filament drive system, the lower filament idler assy requires two cnc machined delrin V-Groove idler filament bearings riding on a 4mm smooth shaft. These idlers transfer the horizontal movement of the filament from the stepper motors and Filament Drive Reel vertically into the t-slot of the extrusion

2- The Cerberus vertical carriages roll up and down on 3 cnc machined delrin 'w' rollers per tower. The roller assy consists of a cnc machined delrin cover with a 608zz bearing pressed in. The roller rides in the T-Slot of the 1515-lite extrusion. This makes for a very smooth and accurate linear carriage system. 'w' Rollers and 608zz bearings can be purchased from grabercars@gmail.com

3- Filament drive reels must be very strong, so print them with at least 80% infill and make sure your layers are well bonded. If you can print these out of nylon that would be best. Make sure they are accurate in their concentricity of the inner shaft to outer surface. As well, the O.D. should be as close to 18mm as possible. The print accuracy of your Cerberus printer depends greatly on the accuracy of these drive reels. To achieve the best result you can chuck these printed parts up in a lathe. First chuck the O.D. and center drill the I.D. to 5mm, then using a 5mm long bolt and nut to secure the reel from spinning, chuck the 5mm bolt in the lathe and turn the outer surface down to 18mm O.D. This will give you a good I.D. for the stepper motor shaft as well as a very concentric O.D. Your stepper motors should have 'D' shafts.

4- I will be making this part available for sale, manufactured on a CNC lathe out of either Delrin or aluminum. Contact Steve at grabercars@gmail.com

5- Due to the high tension required of the spectra filament drive, the upper idler adjuster bearing carrier requires one machined delrin V-Groove idler filament bearing per vertical tower, riding on an 8mm shaft. This upper idler bearing transfers the upward motion of the spectra filament at the top of the printer towers into downward motion. I used a printed 8mm idler bearing shaft borrowed from Airtrippers Bowden extruder (Search www.thingiverse.com) and manufactured the delrin V-Groove idlers with 8mm I.D. hole on a CNC lathe.
